<div>We may use cookies and similar tracking technologies (like web beacons and pixels) to access or store information. Specific information about how we use such technologies and how you can refuse certain cookies is set out in our Cookie Notice.</div>

<div>If you are a resident in the European Economic Area, then these countries may not necessarily have data protection laws or other similar laws as comprehensive as those in your country. We will however take all necessary measures to protect your personal information in accordance with this privacy notice and applicable law.</div>
<div><strong>6. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</strong></div>
<div><strong><em>In Short:&nbsp;</em></strong><em>&nbsp;We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this privacy notice unless otherwise required by law.</em></div>

No purpose in this notice will require us keeping your personal information for longer than __________.</div>
<div>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</div>

However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security, and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our App is at your own risk. You should only access the App within a secure environment.</div>
<div><strong>8. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?</strong></div>

<div><strong>9. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</strong></div>
<div>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>10. DO CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS HAVE SPECIFIC PRIVACY RIGHTS?</strong></div>
<div><strong><em>In Short:&nbsp;</em></strong><em>&nbsp;Yes, if you are a resident of California, you are granted specific rights regarding access to your personal information.</em></div>
<div>California Civil Code Section 1798.83, also known as the "Shine The Light" law, permits our users who are California residents to request and obtain from us, once a year and free of charge, information about categories of personal information (if any) we disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes and the names and addresses of all third parties with which we shared personal information in the immediately preceding calendar year.

<div><strong>11. DO WE MAKE UPDATES TO THIS NOTICE?</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
